DESCRIPTION
===========

Since the actual configuration area of the SJA1105 switch is write-only,
the sja1105-tool does not actually retrieve it from the switch over SPI.
Instead, all config operations work with a local "staging area" (a file)
where a binary form of the switch configuration is held.

Modifying and inspecting the configuration operate on this staging area,
which is local to the host processor. The staging area is only uploaded
("committed") to the switch via the "**sja1105-tool config upload**" command.

The location of the staging area is specified in **/etc/sja1105/sja1105.conf**,
property "staging-area" under the \[spi-setup\] section.


ACTIONS
=======

show \[_`TABLE_NAME`_\]

:   - Read the configuration stored in the staging area, and display it to
      stdout in a human-readable form, compatible with the interpretation
      found in UM10944.pdf.

    - If no TABLE_NAME is specified then the whole switch configuration is
      displayed.

    - Each entry of the table is displayed on its own column to make better
      use of screen space (width). The "screen-width" and "entries-per-line"
      properties under the \[general\] section of **/etc/sja1105/sja1105.conf**
      are taken into account for this operation.

default [-f|--flush] _ls1021atsn_

:   - This configuration is built into the sja1105-tool. It is only
      guaranteed to provide a meaningful configuration for the NXP LS1021ATSN
      board. The builtin configuration is saved to the staging area.
      Run "**sja1105-tool config show**" to see its contents.

    - Invoking with -f or --flush activates the flush condition. See
      sja1105-tool-config(1) for more details.

upload

:   - Read the configuration stored in the staging area, packetize it in 260-byte
      messages and "commit" (send) it over SPI to the SJA1105 switch.

    - The SJA1105 switch needs a cold reset prior to this operation. The reset
      command is issued automatically before sending the configuration.

    - Prior to committing the configuration to the SJA1105 switch,
      some basic validity checks are performed. See
      sja1105-tool-config-format(5) for more details.

    - Some checks are made to make sure that the device at the other end
      is really a SJA1105 (responds 9e00030e to the device id query) and
      that it responds positively to the configuration we are uploading
      (CRC checks, validity checks apart from our own).

    - After the configuration is sent to the switch, a proper Clock Generation
      Unit (CGU, see chapter 5.3 in UM10944.pdf) configuration is determined
      from the xMII Mode Parameters Table present in the staging area. The CGU
      configuration is programmed automatically at the end of this command.

    - If the flush condition is true (either because "auto_flush" is set
      to true in /etc/sja1105/sja1105.conf or because another command
      was run with -f|--flush, this command is performed automatically
      after each modification brought to the staging area through the
      sja1105-tool. See sja1105-conf(5) for more details.

    - If the "dry_run" option is set to true in /etc/sja1105/sja1105.conf,
      then no write operation will actually be performed to SPI,
      regardless of the flush condition value. Instead, a hexdump of the
      SPI messages will be printed to stdout. Also see sja1105-conf(5).

save _`XML_FILE`_

:   - Read the configuration stored in the staging area and export it in a
      human-readable form to the _`XML_FILE`_ specified.

load [-f|--flush] _`XML_FILE`_

:   - Import the SJA1105 switch configuration stored in the _`XML_FILE`_ specified,
      and write it to the staging area.

    - Invoking with -f or --flush activates the flush condition. See
      sja1105-tool-config(1) for more details.

hexdump

:   - Read the configuration stored in the staging area, and display a hexdump
      interpretation to stdout. Individual entries of each configuration tables
      are identified and separated according to their table headers.

new

:   - Write an empty SJA1105 switch configuration to the staging area.

modify [-f|--flush] _`TABLE_NAME`_\[_`ENTRY_INDEX`_\] _`FIELD_NAME`_ _`FIELD_NEW_VALUE`_

:   - Change the entry _`ENTRY_INDEX`_ of _`TABLE_NAME`_: set _`FIELD_NAME`_
      to _`FIELD_NEW_VALUE`_.

    - _`ENTRY_INDEX`_ must be specified in square brackets right next to
      _`TABLE_NAME`_  (no spaces in between). If `ENTRY_INDEX` is not specified
      it is assumed to be zero.

    - _`ENTRY_INDEX`_ must be larger or equal to zero, and strictly smaller than
      "entry-count" of _`TABLE_NAME`_.

    - The possibilities for _`FIELD_NAME`_ are unique to each _`TABLE_NAME`_
      and are listed in UM10944.pdf.

    - Additionally, if _`FIELD_NAME`_ is "entry-count", then _`TABLE_NAME`_ is
      resized to have _`FIELD_NEW_VALUE`_ entries. All the fields of a new entry
      are set to zero. Erasing a configuration table may be done by setting
      the "entry-count" to zero and then back to its original value.

    - If _`FIELD_NAME`_ points to an array, then _`FIELD_NEW_VALUE`_ should be
      specified to the sja1105-tool enclosed in quotes. This prevents the shell
      from interpreting array elements as separate parameters.

    - Invoking with -f or --flush activates the flush condition. See
      sja1105-tool-config(1) for more details.

BUGS
====

Showing a single entry of a configuration table is currently not supported.

The following configuration tables are currently unsupported:

* Clock Synchronization Parameters Table (TABLE := clock-synchronization-parameters-table)
* Retagging Table (TABLE := retagging-table)
